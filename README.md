This is a repo for school assignment (mainly build)

This project implements a TCP-based sensor data management system, responsible for acquiring data from sensor nodes and transmitting it over the network to be processed in a database. Technically, it uses C language for low-level programming, integrating network communication and data buffering mechanisms to ensure the reliable transmission and management of sensor data.

该项目实现了一个基于 TCP 的传感器数据管理系统，负责从传感器节点获取数据并通过网络传输至数据库进行处理。技术上使用 C 语言进行低级编程，结合网络通信和数据缓冲机制来实现传感器数据的可靠传输与管理。
